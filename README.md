# About Me
Hello! I'm a student in the Telling Stories with Data course.

Fascinated by the interaction between art and technology, I’m currently learning Interaction Design at Carnegie Mellon University.

Previously worked as an architecture designer for Aedas.

Trying to be a Human-Centered Designer who knows how to combine leaps of the imagination with remarkable feats of engineering.

# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn how to better express data, and also basic code knowledge related to it.

# Portfolio
Here's where all of my cool data visualizations will go.
