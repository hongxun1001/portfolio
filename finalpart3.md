[Back to main page](/README.md)

## 1.The Project Outline

At its peak value of $174.7 billion on Tuesday, 4th February, Tesla was the 30th-largest stock in the U.S. and by far the largest never to have made a full-year profit. Starting introducing the recent big news about Tesla, the leap of its stock, the behind drive and trend will be discussed such as the cars are becoming more affordable, the sufficient distribution of the supercharger stations and the increasing awareness of the clean energy usage. And finally advocate people to purchase electric cars to stop destroying the earth and support the surge of electric car industry. 


## 2.The Process

Towards the final project, there were three separate parts that I have gone through. 

In part 1, I confirmed the topic I would handle for the project and I caught the most recent hot news in business world-Tesla stock- to start my research. And I designed the story arch and the overall structure of the story I am planning to tell. Then I start searching for the authentic data about the Tesla and also some supporting data of CO2 emission and global warming. Afterwards, I sketched my initial thought and wireframes for the final project.

In Part 2, The sketches were iterated with specific data that I found and some interpretation on them. Then I conducted user testing to see whether the sequence of the story is clear and intuitive enough for the audience. After I collected feedbacks from my interviewees, I made some significant changes on the initial outline.

In Part 3, I proceeded to finalize my presentation using high fidelity data visualizations with the support of Tableau and related images through Shorthand online platform.

## 4.The Intended Audience & User Research


The target audience were the people that drive traditional gasoline-powered cars and the ones that are considering buying a new car.  I didnâ€™t introduce the project at first and left the interviewee to go through all the wireframes by themselves and asked what part is confusing and why. After I explain what I plan to deliver, I asked questions like whether all the charts are clear enough to understand, intuitive and easy to understand and what changes are they going to make for promotions and whether the overall story is worth being told.

From the test, I was suggested the description should be concise and key words should be highlighted. Some charts need to be more elaborate The transition between performance factor of Tesla and sustainability part is too abrupt. The last part should add some facts that sustainability is adding values to the products and customers are willing to care about whether they are buying eco-friendly products.


## 5.Summary of Final Presentation

After I finished part 3 and before the final presentation, I collected all the visualizations created by Tableau, I uploaded them to short hand and to see whether they fit well for the website layout. Then I organized all of them in a preferred size for showing in shorthand. Then I created the guideline for the graphics and worked on Photoshop to put interpretation of the visualizations.
