# About Me
Hello! I'm a student in the Telling Stories with Data course.

Fascinated by the interaction between art and technology, Iâ€™m currently learning Interaction Design at Carnegie Mellon University.

Previously worked as an architecture designer for Aedas.

Trying to be a Human-Centered Designer who knows how to combine leaps of the imagination with remarkable feats of engineering.

# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn how to better express data, and also basic code knowledge related to it.

Here's where all of my cool data visualizations will go.
