Starting introducing the recent big news about Tesla, the leap of its stock, the behind drive and trend will be discussed such as the cars are becoming more affordable, the sufficient distribution of the supercharger stations and the increasing awareness of the clean energy usage. And finally advocate people to purchase electric cars to stop destroying the earth and support the surge of electric car industry.

## 3.User Research

The above improvement was made based on the user research.

### 3.1Target Audience and Participants

The target audience were the people that drives traditional gasoline-powered cars and the ones that are considering buying a new car.

### 3.2 Interview Protocol

I didnâ€™t introduced the project at first and leave the interviewee to go through all the wireframes by themselves and asked what part is confusing and why. After I explain what I plan to deliver, I started asking below questions.
```
1. All the charts are clear enough to understand?
2. Is it intuitive and easy to understand?
3. What you would like to change if you have the right to make changes?
4. Do you think the overall story is worth being told?
```
### 3.3 Findings & Insights

The description should be concise and key words should be highlighted.
Some charts need to be more elaborate
The transition between performance factor of Tesla and sustainability part is too abrupt.
The last part should add some facts that sustainability is adding values to the products and customers are willing to care about whether they are buying eco-friendly products.
